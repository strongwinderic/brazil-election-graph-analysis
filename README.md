1. Ensure you have the required .zip files from https://dados.gov.br/dataset/resultados-2022-boletim-de-urna and copy them to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/Data/DumpFiles` directory.
2. Build the project using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
3. Run the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis` project.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate the charts.

For more details, refer to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/Program.cs` file.

## How the charts were generated

The charts were generated using the `AnalyticsChartsBuilder` class in the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis` namespace. This class takes in voting data and generates various charts, including random charts, tendency charts, and stealing votes charts. The charts are saved as PNG files in the specified directory.

For more details, refer to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/AnalyticsChartsBuilder.cs` file.
