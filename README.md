## Instructions to run the software and generate the graphs

To run the software and generate the graphs, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required .zip files from https://dados.gov.br/dataset/resultados-2022-boletim-de-urna and copy them to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/Data/DumpFiles` directory.
2. Build the project using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
3. Run the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis` project.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate the charts.

For more details, refer to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/Program.cs` file.

## How the charts were generated

The charts were generated using the `AnalyticsChartsBuilder` class in the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis` namespace. This class takes in voting data and generates various charts, including random charts, tendency charts, and stealing votes charts. The charts are saved as PNG files in the specified directory.

For more details, refer to the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis/AnalyticsChartsBuilder.cs` file.

## FAQ

### What is the purpose of this project?

The purpose of this project is to analyze the voting data from the Brazilian elections and generate various charts to visualize the data.

### What data is used in this project?

The project uses voting data from the 2022 Brazilian elections, which can be downloaded from https://dados.gov.br/dataset/resultados-2022-boletim-de-urna.

### How are the charts generated?

The charts are generated using the `AnalyticsChartsBuilder` class, which processes the voting data and creates various charts, including random charts, tendency charts, and stealing votes charts.

## About the Analysis

This project provides statistical analysis tools to examine voting patterns and data integrity in the 2022 Brazilian elections. The analysis aims to provide transparency and enable independent verification of electoral data, particularly in light of documented concerns about institutional oversight and process transparency.

The `ChartTools` class in the `BrazilElectionGraphAnalysis` namespace provides methods to generate various charts that visualize voting patterns, including:
- Tendency charts that order voting data by different criteria
- Random sampling charts that show voting patterns with randomized ballot ordering
- Vote distribution simulations that model hypothetical scenarios

These tools allow researchers and analysts to examine the data from multiple perspectives and understand voting pattern behaviors under different conditions.

## Chart Examples

### Tendency Chart

This chart shows the tendency of votes for Lula and Bolsonaro over time. The data is ordered by the number of votes for Bolsonaro in descending order.

### Stealing Votes Chart

This chart simulates the effect of stealing votes from Lula and giving them to Bolsonaro. The data is ordered randomly, and a certain percentage of votes are stolen from Lula and given to Bolsonaro.

### Random Charts

These charts show random samples of voting data. Each chart is generated by randomly shuffling the voting data and plotting the votes for Lula and Bolsonaro over time.
